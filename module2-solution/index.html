			That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.

We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.

			I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.
